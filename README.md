## Evaluate the performance of each model

Use the notebooks to answer the following:

> Which model has a lower loss?

    The LSTM model using the closing prices has a lower loss.

> Which model tracks the actual values better over time?

    The LSTM model using the closing prices tracks the actual values better over time.

> Which window size works best for the model?

    I believe window size = 10 works best.
